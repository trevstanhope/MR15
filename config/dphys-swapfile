### ------ configuration for this site

# where we want the swapfile to be, this is the default
CONF_SWAPFILE=/var/swap

# size we want to force it to be, default (empty) gives 2*RAM
CONF_SWAPSIZE=

# this is what we want, 2 times RAM size
CONF_SWAPFACTOR=2

# Formerly a hard kernel limit (in MBytes), now a safeguard from using
# up too much disk space on modern computers with a lot of RAM
CONF_MAXSWAP=2048
